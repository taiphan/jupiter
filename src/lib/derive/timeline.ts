/**
 * Pure helpers for the Timeline view (Req 3.2).
 *
 * The Timeline page draws one row per epic with a bar that spans the work
 * its child stories represent: from the earliest child `startDate` (falling
 * back to `createdAt` when start is unset) to the latest child `dueDate`.
 * `computeEpicSpan` is the deterministic, side-effect-free helper that
 * computes that range so the renderer, integration tests, and `fast-check`
 * property tests can all share the same source of truth.
 *
 * **Empty / partial spans.** Per Req 3.2 an epic with no children renders a
 * zero-width placeholder bar at the epic's own `dueDate` (or `createdAt`).
 * That placeholder is a UI concern — this helper's contract is "no usable
 * span" → returns `null`. The renderer is responsible for rendering the
 * placeholder when the helper returns `null`. We treat the same way the
 * case where no child carries a `dueDate`: a span is undefined without an
 * end, even though a start could be derived from `createdAt`.
 *
 * **Why no `now` parameter.** Task 11.2 calls for "Pure; injected `now`",
 * but the span depends only on the input issues' own dates — no clock read
 * is needed to compute it. We therefore omit `now` from the signature in
 * favor of the cleanest contract: feed in issues, get back a span. The
 * Today_Marker (Req 3.9) takes its `now` from a separate helper
 * (`computeTodayPx`, task 11.3).
 *
 * **Input shape.** The helper accepts narrow structural types because the
 * full `Issue` type carries a lot of unrelated fields. TypeScript's
 * structural typing allows callers to pass full `Issue` objects directly —
 * the extra properties are ignored. Both the epic and its children share
 * the same minimal shape.
 *
 * **Why the epic is in the signature even though it's currently unused.**
 * The task text specifies `computeEpicSpan(epic, children)`, and the
 * design document mirrors that contract. We keep the epic parameter so
 * future iterations can fall back to the epic's own dates without
 * breaking call sites; today the helper does not consult it.
